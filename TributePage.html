        <h1>Tribute to Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        <h2>About Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
        <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Born
            on June 8, 1955, in London, he grew up in a family deeply involved in computer technology, which influenced
            his career path. Berners-Lee conceived the idea of a global hypertext system in 1989 while working at CERN,
            the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

            His vision was to create a system that would allow people to access and share information over the internet
            seamlessly. In 1991, he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            (HTTP) client and server via the internet. This groundbreaking invention fundamentally transformed the way
            we communicate, access information, and conduct business.

            Sir Tim is not just a technical pioneer but also an advocate for internet freedom and neutrality. He
            believes that the web should remain free, open, and accessible to everyone. In 2009, he founded the World
            Wide Web Foundation, which seeks to advance the web as a public good and a basic right.</p>

        <img src="static/tbl2.jpeg" alt="Image" class="main-img">
        <p><b><u>The Birth of the Web (1989):</u></b> One of the most iconic moments in Sir Tim Berners-Lee's career
            occurred in 1989
            when he proposed the idea of the World Wide Web while working at CERN. His vision was to create a platform
            where information could be shared easily across the globe. This idea gave birth to the modern internet,
            changing the way humans interact, communicate, and access knowledge. <br>

            <b><u>First Web Page (1991):</u></b> Another key moment was in 1991 when the first-ever web page was
            launched. It was a
            simple document that explained what the World Wide Web was, how to access documents, and set the foundation
            for what the internet would grow into today. <br>

            <b><u>Founding the World Wide Web Consortium (1994):</u></b> To ensure that the web remained open and
            accessible to
            everyone, Sir Tim founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This organization establishes web standards
            and guidelines, ensuring the web evolves in a way that benefits everyone. <br>

            <b><u>Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II (2004):</u></b> His remarkable contribution to technology was
            recognized when he was
            knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the global development of the Internet. This moment cemented
            his status as one of the most influential figures in modern history. <br>

            <b><u>World Wide Web Foundation (2009):</u></b> Another milestone was the establishment of the World Wide
            Web Foundation
            in 2009, through which Sir Tim advocates for digital equality and access. His efforts continue to push for a
            web that is a basic right for all humanity.
